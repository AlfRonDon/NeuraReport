This template renders a single tabular sheet (Sheet1) listing time-series readings from multiple flowmeters. Each row corresponds to a timestamp (UTC) from the neuract__Flowmeters table, with 23 associated flowmeter channel values. There are no totals or scalar tokens; all placeholders are row-level tokens. The mapping uses only catalog-allowed columns and relies on a single source table without joins.
