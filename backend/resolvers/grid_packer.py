"""
Deterministic grid packing — no LLM, always valid.

Replaces V5's LLM grid proposal + rectpack validation loop with
a single-pass deterministic bin-packing algorithm.

Algorithm:
1. Sort widgets by size (hero > expanded > normal > compact)
2. Place hero widgets first (full width)
3. Fill rows with expanded + normal widgets
4. Pack compact widgets into remaining gaps

Guaranteed valid layout in <10ms. No iterations needed.
